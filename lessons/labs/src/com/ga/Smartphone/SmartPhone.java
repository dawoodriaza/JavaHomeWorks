/**
 *
 *2️⃣ Create a Smartphones Interface
 * Your interface should contain at least 7 method definitions related to smartphone behavior.
 * Example ideas (you may choose your own):
 *
 * makeCall()
 * sendMessage()
 * takePhoto()
 * connectToWifi()
 * installApp()
 * openCamera()
 * playMusic()
 * 3️⃣ Create a Smartphone Base Class
 * Implement all interface methods inside this class.
 * This class will act as the base implementation for all smartphone types.
 * 4️⃣ Create a Main Class (Driver)
 * Your Main class should:
 * Create objects
 * Call methods
 * Print outputs
 * This will serve as the entry point for the whole application.
 * 5️⃣ Create 5 Different Smartphone Classes
 * Create five subclasses, each representing a different smartphone brand/model.
 *
 * Each subclass should override methods from the base class.
 * Follow the same approach as your Automobile example.
 * Examples:
 *
 * iPhone
 * Samsung
 * Huawei
 * Pixel
 * OnePlus
 * 6️⃣ Define at Least 2 Common Methods
 * All smartphone classes must implement at least two shared behaviors, such as:
 *
 * unlockPhone()
 * chargeBattery()
 * These should still be overridden to show class-specific behavior.
 *
 * 7️⃣ Print Smartphone Details
 * In your Main class, print meaningful details about each smartphone object.
 * Example outputs:
 * Phone type
 * Unique features
 * Overridden method behaviors
 * Use organized, readable console output for better clarity.
